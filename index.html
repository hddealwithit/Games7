    <span class="author-sub">Ref: 001-ENG-LIT</span>
    <div id="articleText">
        <p>William Shakespeare (1564–1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor who is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and married Anne Hathaway at the age of 18. Throughout his career, he produced roughly 39 plays and 154 sonnets that reshaped the landscape of Western literature. His early works were primarily comedies and histories, genres he mastered with unrivaled wit. Plays like "A Midsummer Night's Dream" demonstrated his ability to blend folklore with complex human emotion. As he matured, he turned toward tragedies, creating some of the most profound works in any language. "Hamlet," "Othello," and "King Lear" explore the depths of betrayal, madness, and ambition. His influence on the English language cannot be overstated, as he coined thousands of words still used today. The Globe Theatre became the home for his company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. Audiences from all walks of life flocked to see his performances, which bridged the gap between royalty and commoners. His use of iambic pentameter provided a rhythmic heartbeat to his dialogue that remains iconic. Many scholars debate the "authorship question," yet historical records firmly place Shakespeare at the center of his work. His sonnets often dealt with themes of time, love, and beauty, showcasing a more personal side of his genius. He retired to Stratford several years before his death, having achieved significant financial success. Even today, his plays are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Translations of his work exist in every major living language, proving the universality of his themes. He understood the "human condition" better than almost any individual in history. His characters, from the tragic Macbeth to the comedic Falstaff, feel as real today as they did four centuries ago. The First Folio, published posthumously in 1623, ensured his legacy would survive for generations. Shakespeare's impact on film and modern storytelling is visible in nearly every dramatic medium. He explored the nuances of power and the frailty of the ego with surgical precision. His mastery of the "soliloquy" allowed audiences to peer directly into the souls of his protagonists. Scholars continue to find new layers of meaning in his complex metaphors and wordplay. The sheer volume of his output remains a testament to his incredible discipline and imagination. To read Shakespeare is to engage with the very foundation of modern drama. He challenged the social norms of his time while respecting the traditions of the classical past. His ability to evoke empathy for even his villains is a hallmark of his sophisticated morality. Whether in the classroom or on the global stage, his voice remains a guiding light for literary excellence. Truly, he was not of an age, but for all time.</p>

            text: "Plato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy. Born into an aristocratic family, he was a student of Socrates and later became the teacher of Aristotle. His dialogues are among the most influential works in the history of human thought. The 'Republic' is perhaps his most famous work, detailing his vision of an ideal state governed by philosopher-kings. In this text, he explores the nature of justice and the order of the soul. His 'Theory of Forms' suggests that the physical world is not as real as the abstract, unchanging ideas that inhabit a higher realm. To Plato, the things we see around us are merely shadows of these perfect forms. This concept is famously illustrated in the 'Allegory of the Cave,' where prisoners mistake shadows on a wall for reality. He believed that the purpose of education was to lead the soul out of the cave and into the light of truth. His writings covered a vast array of subjects, including ethics, metaphysics, and political philosophy. He used the Socratic method of dialogue to challenge the assumptions of his peers. Plato’s influence on Christian theology and modern science is profound and enduring. He argued that the soul is immortal and exists before and after the body. His dialectical approach encouraged critical thinking and the pursuit of objective knowledge. In the 'Symposium,' he explored the nature of love as a ladder leading to the contemplation of divine beauty. He was deeply affected by the execution of Socrates, which shaped his skepticism toward democracy. Throughout his life, he sought to reconcile the changing nature of the physical world with the permanence of reason. His Academy survived for centuries, fostering the growth of mathematical and philosophical inquiry. Plato’s work remains a cornerstone of the liberal arts curriculum in universities worldwide. He believed that the unexamined life was not worth living, a sentiment inherited from his mentor. His prose is often praised for its poetic quality and dramatic tension. He tackled the problem of 'the One and the Many,' seeking unity in diversity. Modern philosophy is often described as a series of footnotes to Plato. His dedication to truth over opinion set the standard for intellectual integrity. By examining the nature of the Good, he provided a moral compass for Western civilization. His legacy continues to provoke debate and inspire seekers of wisdom today."

            title: "Charles Darwin: Evolution",
            ref: "003-BIO-SCI",
            text: "Charles Darwin was an English naturalist whose theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern biology. Born in 1809, he initially studied medicine but found his true passion in the natural sciences. His voyage on the HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836 was the defining event of his professional life. During this journey, he observed a vast diversity of plants and animals across South America and the Galapagos Islands. He noticed that species on different islands had unique adaptations suited to their specific environments. These observations led him to wonder how new species might arise over long periods. Upon returning to England, he spent decades meticulously gathering evidence to support his ideas. He studied barnacles, pigeons, and geology to build a comprehensive case for common descent. In 1859, he published 'On the Origin of Species,' a book that fundamentally changed how we view life on Earth. He proposed that individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This process, which he called natural selection, results in the gradual evolution of populations over generations. Darwin was deeply aware of the controversy his theory would cause in Victorian society. He delayed publication for years until he received a manuscript from Alfred Russel Wallace outlining similar ideas. His work provided a scientific explanation for the complexity and diversity of life without relying on supernatural intervention. Later, in 'The Descent of Man,' he applied his theories to human evolution, suggesting a common ancestor with primates. His ideas were initially met with significant resistance from both the scientific and religious communities. However, the discovery of genetics and the fossil record eventually provided overwhelming support for his core claims. Darwin’s concept of the 'survival of the fittest' is often misunderstood as favoring brute strength, whereas it actually refers to reproductive success. He was a keen observer of animal behavior and the intricacies of ecological relationships. His work on orchids and earthworms showed that even the smallest organisms play a vital role in nature. Darwin's influence extends far beyond biology, impacting sociology, psychology, and philosophy. He taught us that all living things are connected in a great 'tree of life.' His commitment to empirical evidence and rigorous testing remains a model for scientific inquiry. Today, evolutionary biology is an essential tool for medicine, conservation, and agriculture. Charles Darwin’s legacy is a testament to the power of curiosity and the courage to challenge established dogma. His resting place in Westminster Abbey reflects his status as one of history's most significant thinkers."
